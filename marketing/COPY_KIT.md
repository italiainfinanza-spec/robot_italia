### Email 2: Value Proof (Day 2)

**Subject:** This deal closed yesterday. Our readers knew 48 hours early.

**Preview Text:** Speed is the only real advantage in robotics investing.

---

**Body:**

{{first_name|Hey}},

Quick story.

Last Tuesday, Field AI announced a $65M Series B led by Temasek.

Our Premium readers knew Monday morning.

Not because we have insider information—we don't. But because we read every SEC filing, every LinkedIn post, every job listing so you don't have to.

**That's the Robotica Weekly difference.**

Speed isn't a nice-to-have in robotics investing. It's everything.

When Figure AI raised $1.3B at a $39B valuation, the stock moved 12% in pre-market. If you knew Thursday night (our briefing time) instead of Friday morning (press release time), you had an edge.

**This is what you get every day:**

- Funding rounds (with investor lists) within hours of closing
- Stock price reactions to robotics news
- Exclusive commentary from robotics founders
- The stories mainstream financial media misses

Tomorrow's briefing covers NVIDIA's Physical AI platform and what it means for 6 robotics stocks we track.

See you then.

**Template 2: Hot Take/Contrarian**
```
Everyone's obsessed with humanoid robots.

They're missing the bigger opportunity: Physical AI.

NVIDIA's Cosmos platform isn't just another product launch. It's the CUDA moment for robotics.

The companies that master Physical AI will dominate the next decade.

The ones that don't will be acquired for parts.

Today's briefing covers the 6 stocks most exposed to this shift.

(Link in comments for subscribers)

#PhysicalAI #NVIDIA #robotics #investing
```

**Template 3: Educational/Carousel**
```
The 5 robotics companies I'm tracking in 2026:

1️⃣ Figure AI — $39B valuation, 100,000 robot target
2️⃣ Boston Dynamics — Hyundai integration play
3️⃣ Tesla Optimus — Manufacturing at scale
4️⃣ Agility Robotics — Warehouse-first approach
5️⃣ Unitree Robotics — Cost leadership

Each has a different bet on:
→ Market timing
→ Technical approach
→ Business model

The winner won't be obvious for 5+ years.

But the patterns are emerging.

Full analysis in today's briefing.

**Template 4: Behind-the-Scenes**

What I learned interviewing 12 robotics CEOs this quarter:

→ Everyone is hiring
→ No one can find enough engineers
→ China is 2–3 years ahead on manufacturing
→ Figure AI's deal flow is unprecedented
→ European robotics is undervalued

The gap between perception and reality in this market is massive.

That's why I started Robotica Weekly.

Not to hype. To inform.

**Template 1: Quick Take**

Figure AI just raised $1.3B at $39B.

That's:
→ 4x their last round (6 months ago)
→ Higher than many public robotics companies
→ Pre-revenue (mostly)

The humanoid robot race is officially a capital arms race.

My briefing this morning covers what this means for 6 stocks:
