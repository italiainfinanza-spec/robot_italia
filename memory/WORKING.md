## Recommendation Summary

**PLATFORM: Beehiiv (Scale Plan @ $43/mo)**

### Why Beehiiv Wins for Robotica Weekly:
1. **0% take rate** on paid subscriptions (vs 10% on Substack)
2. **Native monetization** built-in (vs complex integrations for Mailchimp/SendGrid)
3. **Advanced automations** for nurture sequences
4. **Built-in referral program** for organic growth
5. **Full GDPR compliance** for Italian market

### Cost Comparison @ 100 Paid Subscribers (€4.99/mo):
- **Beehiiv:** ~€439 net/month
- **Substack:** ~€432 net/month
- **Mailchimp:** Not viable (no native paid subscriptions)

Beehiiv becomes MORE profitable than Substack at 100+ paid subscribers due to no revenue share.
