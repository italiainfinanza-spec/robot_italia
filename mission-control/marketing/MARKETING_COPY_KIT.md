## 📱 SOCIAL MEDIA TEMPLATES

### LinkedIn Posts

**Template 1: Market Insight**

```
Everyone's talking about AI chatbots.

Few are paying attention to Physical AI.

NVIDIA's Cosmos platform just changed the game. Here's why:

→ Training robots in virtual worlds before real-world deployment
→ Reducing development costs by 90%+
→ Accelerating the path to commercial humanoid robots

This is the "Android of robotics" moment.

We're tracking the stocks, startups, and trends in this week's Robotica Weekly.

```

**Template 2: Question/Engagement**

```
Quick poll for investors:

Which robotics company would you bet on long-term?

🤖 Tesla (Optimus + manufacturing scale)
🤖 Figure AI ($39B valuation, OpenAI backing)
🤖 Boston Dynamics (hyundai ownership, proven tech)
🤖 NVIDIA (platform play, Cosmos)
🤖 Someone else (comment below)

We're covering all of them in this week's analysis.

**Template 3: Story/Behind the Scenes**

```
I started Robotica Weekly because I was tired of:

❌ Robotics news written for engineers (too technical)
❌ Finance coverage that missed the technology (too superficial)
❌ Generic "AI" newsletters that lumped everything together

So we built something different:

✅ Robotics investing intelligence for humans
✅ 5-minute reads with actionable insights
✅ Italian perspective on a global market

1,000+ subscribers in our first month.

If you're curious about the robotics revolution, join us.
