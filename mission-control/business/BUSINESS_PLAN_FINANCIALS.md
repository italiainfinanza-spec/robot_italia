## 3. Lifetime Value (LTV) Calculations

### 3.1 LTV Methodology

**Formula:** LTV = (Average Revenue Per User × Gross Margin) / Monthly Churn Rate

### 3.2 LTV by Segment

#### Premium Monthly Subscribers

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Average Revenue Per Month | €15 |
| Gross Margin | 75% (after payment processing) |
| Monthly Churn Rate | 5% |
| Average Lifetime (months) | 20 months |
| **LTV** | **€225** |

#### Premium Annual Subscribers

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Average Revenue Per Year | €150 |
| Gross Margin | 78% (lower processing fees) |
| Annual Churn Rate | 25% |
| Average Lifetime (years) | 4 years |
| **LTV** | **€468** |

#### Blended Premium LTV

| Segment | % of Premium Base | Segment LTV | Weighted Contribution |
|---------|------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Monthly | 60% | €225 | €135 |
| Annual | 40% | €468 | €187 |
| **Blended LTV** | **100%** | — | **€322** |

### 3.3 LTV Evolution

| Year | Blended Premium LTV | CAC | LTV:CAC Ratio |
|------|---------------------|-----|---------------|

| Year 2 | €335 | €22 | 15.2:1 |
| Year 3 | €350 | €18 | 19.4:1 |

**Note:** While LTV:CAC appears extremely high, this reflects the efficiency of newsletter businesses. Industry benchmarks suggest healthy SaaS/media businesses target 3:1+. Our conservative operational threshold uses 3:1 for marketing spend decisions.

### 3.4 Free Subscriber Value

Free subscribers generate value through:
- **Advertising Revenue:** €0.35/subscriber/year (Year 1, scaling with engagement)
- **Premium Conversion Funnel:** 6.5% conversion rate
- **Viral Coefficient:** 0.15 (each free subscriber refers 0.15 new subscribers)
