## Gap Analysis: Where Robotica Wins

### 1. **Investment Focus + Robotics Depth** ⭐
- No competitor combines serious robotics coverage with investment analysis
- The Robot Report has depth but no financial angle
- Not Boring has investment angle but no robotics focus

### 2. **Italian/European Market** ⭐
- ALL competitors are U.S.-centric
- No Italian-language robotics investment content exists
- European investors underserved

### 3. **Daily Premium Format** ⭐
- Daily newsletters are either newsy (Robot Report) or deal-focused (Axios)
- No daily "investment intelligence" for robotics exists
- Sweet spot: Daily curated intel, not just news

### 4. **Accessible Pricing** ⭐
- Professional newsletters (Stratechery, Not Boring) charge $120-220/year
- Free newsletters (Robot Report) have no premium tier
- Opportunity: $60-100/year for premium tier
