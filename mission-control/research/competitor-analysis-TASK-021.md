| **Data Access** | 4/10 | No proprietary databases |
| **Network Effects** | 5/10 | Community building early stage |
| **Switching Costs** | 6/10 | Habit formation takes time |

## Conclusion

Robotica Weekly has a **defensible niche** as the only Italian-language robotics investment newsletter. The competitive landscape is crowded in English but empty in Italian.

**Bottom Line:** We're not competing with CB Insights or PitchBook. We're creating a new category: *Italian Robotics Investment Intelligence*.

The window is open. Move fast.
