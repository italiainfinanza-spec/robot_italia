## 8. GEOPOLITICAL RISK ASSESSMENT

*Research completed: February 3, 2026*  
*Sources: Trade Compliance Resource Hub, HSfKramer analysis, RealClearMarkets*

### Critical Development: Section 232 Investigation into Robotics

**September 24, 2025:** The U.S. Commerce Department initiated a **Section 232 investigation** into robotics and industrial machinery under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. This is the same legal authority used for steel and aluminum tariffs.

| Investigation Detail | Status |
|---------------------|--------|
| **Initiated** | September 24, 2025 |
| **Scope** | Robotics and industrial machinery |
| **Legal Authority** | Section 232 (national security) |
| **Potential Outcome** | Tariffs up to 25% on imports |
| **Affected Countries** | Likely all major exporters (China, EU, Japan, S. Korea) |

**Source:** Trade Compliance Resource Hub (February 2, 2026)

### Risk Matrix for Robotics Sector

| Risk Factor | Impact Level | Probability | Timeframe |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| **U.S. Tariffs on Chinese Robotics** | HIGH | HIGH | Q1-Q2 2026 |
| **CFIUS Scrutiny on Chinese Acquisitions** | MEDIUM | HIGH | Ongoing |
| **Export Controls on AI/Robotics Tech** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | 2026 |
| **EU-China Investment Screening** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | 2026 |
| **Retaliatory Chinese Restrictions** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | 2026 |

### Specific Risk Factors

#### **1. Chinese Robotics IPO Impact (AgiBot, Unitree)**
- **Risk:** U.S. market access restrictions could limit expansion
- **Mitigation:** Hong Kong listings provide alternative capital access
- **Confidence:** Chinese companies appear to be prioritizing Hong Kong over NYSE/NASDAQ

#### **2. Supply Chain Disruption**
- **Critical Minerals:** U.S. and EU both pursuing critical mineral strategies (rare earths for motors)
- **Semiconductor Components:** Continued export restrictions on advanced chips to China
- **Impact:** Component costs could rise 10-20% if tariffs implemented

#### **3. Cross-Border M&A Friction**
- **CFIUS Expansion:** Non-U.S. transactions now subject to U.S. diplomatic pressure
- **EU Investment Screening:** 18 EU member states now have investment screening mechanisms
- **Impact:** Chinese acquirers likely to focus on EU targets over U.S. assets

### Investment Implications

| Scenario | Probability | Market Impact |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Base Case (10-15% tariffs)** | 50% | Moderate cost pressure on U.S. manufacturers |
| **Bear Case (25%+ tariffs)** | 25% | Significant supply chain restructuring required |
| **Bull Case (no new tariffs)** | 25% | Status quo maintained, Chinese IPOs proceed |

### Strategic Recommendations

1. **For Investors:** Favor companies with diversified manufacturing (not China-dependent)
2. **For Chinese Robotics Firms:** Expect Hong Kong to become primary listing venue
3. **For Western Manufacturers:** Potential margin expansion if tariffs protect domestic market
4. **Timeline:** Section 232 findings typically take 270 days → decisions by mid-2026
