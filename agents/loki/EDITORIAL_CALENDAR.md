## Backup Plan (When Things Go Wrong)

### Writer Unavailable?

4. Partner/syndicated content (if available)
5. Run "Classic" - republish best-performing issue

### Slow News Day?
1. Educational deep-dive from vault
2. "Under the Radar" - small stories worth knowing
3. Poll results + analysis + commentary
4. Reader-submitted questions answered
5. "Tool spotlight" - analyze one robotics tool/platform

### Too Much News?
1. Prioritize: Funding > Product Launch > Partnership > Other
2. Group related stories (same sector/theme)
3. Save lower-priority for tomorrow's issue
4. Issue "Special Edition" bulletin for breaking news
5. Expand format (longer issue, more sections)

### Breaking News Conflict?
1. Pause scheduled content
2. Lead with breaking news
3. Move planned content to next day
4. Send alert: "Extra edition coming"
