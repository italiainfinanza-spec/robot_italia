## Loki's Writing Rules

### The Loki Manifesto

> "Every word must earn its place."

---

## Core Principles

### 1. CLARITY OVER CLEVERNESS
- If a sentence confuses, rewrite it
- Simple words > complex words
- One idea per sentence

### 2. ACTIVE VOICE (Mostly)
✅ "Vention raised $110M"
❌ "$110M was raised by Vention"

Exception: When passive serves a purpose (emphasis on object)

### 3. SHORT SENTENCES
- Under 20 words per sentence
- Under 3 sentences per paragraph
- White space is your friend

### 4. STRONG VERBS, WEAK ADJECTIVES
✅ "Vention surged"
❌ "Vention had a very significant increase"

### 5. OXFORD COMMAS ALWAYS
✅ "Investors, founders, and employees"
❌ "Investors, founders and employees"

---

## Newsletter-Specific Rules

### Subject Lines
- 40-50 characters max
- Front-load the benefit
- Use numbers when possible
- Create curiosity gap

Examples:
- ✅ "Vention: $110M per conquistare l'America"
- ✅ "3 azioni robotics che esploderanno nel 2025"
- ❌ "Newsletter Robotica Weekly Edizione 42"

### Opening Hook (First 2 sentences)
- Grab attention immediately
- Promise value
- Set the tone

Example:
```
Questa settimana il settore robotics ha raccolto oltre $200M in funding.
E tu potresti avere l'opportunità di investire prima che diventino famose.
```

### Body Copy
- Use bullet points for lists
- Bold key numbers/facts
- Include visual breaks (emojis, dividers)
- One CTA per section max

### Transitions
- Use subheadings (H3)
- Connect paragraphs logically
- "But" and "However" create tension
- "So" and "Therefore" show conclusion

### Call to Action
- One primary CTA per email
- Action-oriented verbs
- Clear benefit
- Urgency (when real)

Examples:
- ✅ "Leggi l'analisi completa"
- ✅ "Scopri le entry points"
- ❌ "Clicca qui"

## Tone Guidelines

### For Robotica Weekly:
- **Expert but approachable** - You know robotics, but don't talk down
- **Optimistic but realistic** - Highlight opportunities, acknowledge risks
- **Action-oriented** - Give readers something to DO
- **Italian-first** - Use local examples, avoid awkward translations

### Words to Use:
- Opportunità
- Crescita
- Trend
- Insight
- Analisi
- Breakthrough
- Funding

### Words to Avoid:
- "Molto" (use stronger adjectives)
- "Veramente" (weak intensifier)
- "Abbastanza" (vague - be specific)
- "Piuttosto" (weakens your point)
- "Interessante" (be specific WHY)
- "Penso che" (state facts confidently)
- "Forse" (unless discussing risk)
- "Credo" (unless it's genuinely opinion)
- Jargon without explanation
- Clichés ("game changer", "synergy", "leverage" in Italian context)

## Editing Checklist

Before submitting content:

- [ ] Read aloud (does it flow?)
- [ ] Check all numbers/facts
- [ ] Verify all links work
- [ ] Subject line under 50 chars
- [ ] One clear CTA
- [ ] Mobile preview (scannable?)
- [ ] Spell check (Italian!)
- [ ] Remove 10% of words (tighten)

## Emergency Shortcuts

**Need it fast?**
1. Hook + 3 bullet points + CTA = Minimum viable newsletter
2. One strong headline > Three weak ones
3. Specific > Vague (always)

**Stuck?**
- Write the shitty first draft
- Edit later
- Done > Perfect
